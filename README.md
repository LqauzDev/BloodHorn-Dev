  <em>Paranoid firmware bootloader for hostile environments</em>
</p>

> **Heads-up from the maintainer**: BloodHorn is aimed at folks who already live in UEFI land—if PE loaders, TPMs, and attack surfaces sound unfamiliar, you may want a gentler project first.

---

> **Personal note**: I'm balancing BloodHorn development with sarcoma treatment. Contributions, bug reports, and kind messages genuinely help keep the project on track while I focus on my health.

### Where things stand

- **Release train**: v7.80.0 is our current line. It’s good enough for hostile deployments, but still sees active churn. Expect sharp edges.
- **Support window**: I patch regressions and security findings quickly; new features ship when energy allows.
- **Help wanted**: Testing on weird hardware, crash dumps, and reproducible bug reports are the best way to move the needle right now.

## What makes BloodHorn BloodHorn

BloodHorn treats firmware as an adversary instead of a trusted partner. That leads to a few practical rules:

- Strip UEFI dependencies as soon as ExitBootServices succeeds.
- Keep the binary small and auditable so you can reason about every code path.
- Offer serious security features (TPM 2.0, secure boot, formal verification hooks) across seven architectures without dragging runtime baggage along for the ride.

**Built with** the spirit of Coreboot minimalism, GRUB flexibility, and TianoCore correctness.  
**Avoids** dynamic allocation after boot, runtime service lock-in, and opaque blobs.

## Threat model at a glance

We assume:

- Firmware may already be compromised.
- Bootkits are lurking (measured boot and secure verification are table stakes).
- Supply chains get messy; every stage gets cryptographically checked.
- Hardware trust stops at the TPM boundary.

It's not paranoia—recent incident reports keep proving the point.

## Design notes from the maintainer desk

### Security through restraint
- One allocation phase before ExitBootServices, nothing after.
- Bare-metal C, no libc crutches.
- Constant-time crypto and aggressive zeroization.

### Keep it readable
- ~100k LOC including support libraries, written for auditing rather than cleverness.
- No third-party mystery meat in the boot path.
- Formal methods experiments are ongoing; patches welcome.

### Assume the firmware lies
- Custom PE loader (we don't trust the firmware's version).
- Homegrown memory management rather than firmware allocators.
- Direct hardware access and a lean variable footprint.

## What we’re not doing

Intentional omissions that keep the project sharp:

- Maximizing hardware compatibility at the expense of security posture.
- Shipping a flashy GUI—the text UI stays on purpose.
- Loading plugins or scripts that balloon the attack surface.
- Catering to legacy BIOS setups or Windows-first expectations.

If you need those features, there are other loaders that will treat you better.

## Current snapshot

- **Deployment**: Trusted by red teams and firmware researchers who need hard-stop security guarantees.
- **Maturity**: Core flows are stable; bleeding-edge features are opt-in.
- **Audits**: Core stages audited, memory manager verification in progress.
- **Reality check**: Expect occasional firmware-specific quirks—please report them.

## Why we bother

Bootloaders that “just work” often do so by trusting firmware blindly. BloodHorn is the counter-argument: assume compromise, build defensively, and prove your work where possible.

## Safety First

BloodHorn operates at firmware level. Mistakes can render systems unbootable. Read SECURITY.md before use. Always back up existing bootloader.

Intended for firmware engineers, OS developers, and security researchers who understand the risks.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from security researchers, firmware engineers, and OS developers. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

**Areas needing expertise**:
- Formal verification (Coq/Isabelle/HOL)
- Hardware security module integration
- Architecture-specific optimizations
- Cryptographic implementation review

## Project origin

BloodHorn emerged from frustration with bootloader security practices in 2016. Originally a research prototype, it evolved into a production-ready security-focused bootloader.

Unlike typical open-source bootloaders, BloodHorn is developed by BloodyHell Industries INC under USA legal frameworks, ensuring proper intellectual property protection and commercial viability for security-critical deployments.
