    :alt: EDK2 Modified for BloodHorn

Overview
--------
This directory contains a modified version of the `EDK2 (EFI Development Kit II) <https://github.com/tianocore/edk2>`_ framework, specifically tailored for the BloodHorn bootloader. The original EDK2 code has been customized to better suit the needs of BloodHorn while maintaining compatibility with the UEFI specification.

Modifications from Upstream EDK2
--------------------------------

Core Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- **Code Optimization**: Critical paths have been optimized and packages/modules we're stripped for more compatibility  for faster boot times
- **Coreboot Integration**: Improved support for Coreboot as a payload
- **BloodHorn-Specific Drivers**: Custom drivers for BloodHorn's hardware support
